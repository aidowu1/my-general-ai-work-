    "## 1. Simple Explanation of Sequence Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence modeling is about understanding and predicting patterns in ordered data where the position matters. Think of it like reading a sentence - each word depends on the previous words to make sense. In AI, we use sequence models to process data like text (predicting the next word), time series (stock prices over time), or speech (converting audio to text). The key insight is that sequences have temporal or positional dependencies - what comes before influences what comes next. These models learn to capture these relationships and can generate new sequences or make predictions about future elements. Common architectures include RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers, each designed to handle different aspects of sequence dependencies.\n",

    "  - *Time series example*: Stock prices - if Apple stock dropped 5% yesterday and the market is bearish, today's price is likely to be influenced by yesterday's drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of sequence problems**:\n",
    "  - *Sequence-to-sequence*: \"Hello world\" → \"Hola mundo\" (translation)\n",
    "  - *Sequence-to-one*: \"This movie is amazing!\" → \"Positive\" (sentiment analysis)\n",
    "  - *One-to-sequence*: [Image of dog] → \"A golden retriever running in a park\" (image captioning)\n",
    "  - *Many-to-many*: [Audio waveform] → \"Hello how are you\" (speech recognition)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input/output representations and encoding**:\n",

    "  - *Time series example*: Stock price $150.25 → normalized value 0.73 (after min-max scaling)\n",
    "  - *One-hot example*: Word \"dog\" in vocab {cat:0, dog:1, bird:2} → [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Basic RNN Architecture**\n",
    "- **Vanilla RNN structure and forward pass**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: Processing \"I love pizza\"\n",
    "    - Step 1: Process \"I\" → hidden state captures \"someone\"\n",
    "    - Step 2: Process \"love\" + previous hidden → captures \"someone loves something\"\n",
    "    - Step 3: Process \"pizza\" + previous hidden → captures \"someone loves pizza\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden state concept and recurrent connections**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: Reading \"The cat, which was black, meowed\"\n",
    "    - After \"cat\": hidden state = [0.2, 0.8, 0.1] (represents \"cat\")\n",

    "  - *Example*: Training on \"cat sat\"\n",
    "    - Forward: \"cat\" → h₁ → predict \"sat\" → loss = 0.8\n",
    "    - Backward: Error flows back through h₁ to update weights for \"cat\" processing\n",
    "    - This happens for each time step in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: RNN Limitations & Solutions**\n",
    "- **Vanishing gradient problem**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: In \"The cat that lived in Paris for many years finally came home\", by the time we reach \"came\", the gradient signal from \"cat\" has become too weak to learn the connection.\n",
    "  - *Mathematical example*: If gradient = 0.1 and we multiply by 0.5 at each step, after 10 steps: 0.1 × 0.5¹⁰ = 0.0001 (vanished!)\n",

    "- **Cell state vs hidden state**:\n",
    "  - *Cell state example*: Long-term memory storing \"We're talking about cats\" throughout a paragraph\n",

    "- **Information flow through LSTM cells**:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 5: GRU Networks**\n",
    "- **Simplified gating mechanism**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: Instead of 3 gates (forget, input, output), GRU has 2 gates (reset, update)\n",
    "  - *Reset gate example*: When processing \"But the dog...\", reset gate decides to forget previous \"cat\" information\n",
    "  - *Update gate example*: Decides how much of new \"dog\" information to keep vs old information\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison with LSTM**:\n",
    "  - *Speed example*: GRU trains 25% faster on same hardware because fewer parameters\n",
    "  - *Performance example*: On simple tasks like sentiment analysis, GRU performs similarly to LSTM\n",
    "  - *Memory example*: LSTM better for very long sequences (1000+ words), GRU better for shorter sequences\n",

    "**Step 6: Advanced Architectures**\n",
    "- **Bidirectional RNNs**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: \"The animal that I saw yesterday was a ___\"\n",
    "    - Forward RNN: \"The animal that I saw yesterday was a\" → predicts based on left context\n",
    "    - Backward RNN: \"cat\" ← \"a was yesterday saw I that animal The\" → predicts based on right context\n",

    "    - Encoder: \"How\" → \"are\" → \"you?\" → context vector [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.9]\n",
    "    - Decoder: context vector → \"¿\" → \"Cómo\" → \"estás\" → \"?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attention mechanisms**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: Translating \"The black cat sat on the red mat\"\n",
    "    - When generating \"negro\" (black), attention focuses on \"black\" in source\n",
    "    - When generating \"gato\" (cat), attention focuses on \"cat\" in source  \n",
    "    - When generating \"roja\" (red), attention focuses on \"red\" in source\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Modern Approaches**\n",
    "- **Transformer architecture basics**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: Instead of processing \"I love pizza\" sequentially, Transformer processes all words simultaneously\n",
    "  - *Parallel processing*: All positions computed at once instead of waiting for previous steps\n",
    "  - *Self-attention example*: In \"The cat sat on it\", \"it\" attends strongly to \"cat\" to understand what \"it\" refers to\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-attention concept**:\n",
    "  - *Example*: \"The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired\"\n",
    "    - \"it\" pays attention to \"animal\" (not \"street\") to understand the reference\n",
    "    - Attention weights: \"it\" → \"animal\" = 0.9, \"it\" → \"street\" = 0.1\n",
