It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money. The movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I wasn't expecting Justin Timberlake to do that good a job. Considering it is his first movie he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night. It should go pretty well. The cast was great. So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!\",\n          \"I enjoyed The Night Listener very much. It's one of the better movies of the summer.<br /><br />Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire cast was very good. All played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is great as the Mom, and never goes over the top. Everyone is very believable.<br /><br />It's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.<br /><br />The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.<br /><br />Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads. It is not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie was the ending. The director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a minor quibble.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### Sample IMDB \"test\" dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"U_Ygf7tAT5T3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["unique_labels = test_dataset_df[\"sentiment\"].unique()\n","print(f\"\\nunique_labels: {unique_labels}\\n\\n\")\n","test_dataset_df.to_csv(config.test_dataset_path, index=False)\n","test_dataset_df.head()\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":276},"id":"O1JcX2paT_lJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771357598226,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":3894,"user":{"displayName":"adeidowu@hotmail.com","userId":"15313548625752705445"}},"outputId":"15dad8f2-670e-48f6-a000-8a757c21df8d"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","unique_labels: [1 0]\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   sentiment                                             review\n","0          1  One of the other reviewers has mentioned that ...\n","1          1  A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The...\n","2          1  I thought this was a wonderful way to spend ti...\n","3          0  Basically there's a family where a little boy ...\n","4          1  Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is..."],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-da660381-7698-4d75-9481-73124a14f1c1\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>sentiment</th>\n","      <th>review</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>One of the other reviewers has mentioned that ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>A wonderful little production. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>I thought this was a wonderful way to spend ti...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Basically there's a family where a little boy ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-da660381-7698-4d75-9481-73124a14f1c1')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-da660381-7698-4d75-9481-73124a14f1c1 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
