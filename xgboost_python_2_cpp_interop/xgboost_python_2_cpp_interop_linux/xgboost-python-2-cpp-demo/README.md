# XGBoost C++ inference in VS Code Devcontainer (Ubuntu)

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. If prompted, "Reopen in Container" â€” accept. This builds the devcontainer.
3. After the container finishes building, open a terminal in VS Code.
4. Run:
   ./build_and_run.sh

This trains the model in Python, builds the C++ inference binary, and runs inference on the test CSV.
